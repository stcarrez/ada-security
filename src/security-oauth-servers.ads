--  == OAuth Server ==
--  OAuth server side is provided by the <tt>Security.OAuth.Servers</tt> package.
--  This package allows to implement the authorization framework described in RFC 6749
--  "The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework".
--
--  The authorization method produces a <tt>Grant_Type</tt> object that contains the result
--  of the grant (successful or denied).  It is the responsibility of the caller to format
--  the result in JSON/XML and return it to the client.
--
--  Three important operations are defined for the OAuth 2.0 framework.  They will be used
--  in the following order:
--
--  <tt>Authorize</tt> is used to obtain an authorization request.  This operation is
--  optional in the OAuth 2.0 framework since some authorization method directly return
--  the access token.  This operation is used by the "Authorization Code Grant" and the
--  "Implicit Grant".
--
--  <tt>Token</tt> is used to get the access token and optional refresh token.  Each time it
--  is called, a new token is generated.
--
--  <tt>Authenticate</tt> is used for the API request to verify the access token
--  and authenticate the API call.  This operation can be called several times with the same
--  token until the token is revoked or it has expired.
--
--  Several grant types are supported.
--
--  === Application Manager ===
--  The application manager maintains the repository of applications which are known by
--  the server and which can request authorization.  Each application is identified by
--  a client identifier (represented by the <tt>client_id</tt> request parameter).
--  The application defines the authorization methods which are allowed as well as
--  the parameters to control and drive the authorization.  This includes the redirection
--  URI, the application secret, the expiration delay for the access token.
--
--  The application manager is implemented by the application server and it must
--  implement the <tt>Application_Manager</tt> interface with the <tt>Find_Application</tt>
--  method.  The <tt>Find_Application</tt> is one of the first call made during the
--  authenticate and token generation phases.
--
--  === Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant ===
--  The password grant is one of the easiest grant method to understand but it is also one
--  of the less secure.  In this grant method, the username and user password are passed in
--  the request parameter together with the application client identifier.  The realm verifies
--  the username and password and when they are correct it generates the access token with
--  an optional refresh token.  The realm also returns in the grant the user principal that
--  identifies the user.
--
--    Realm : Security.OAuth.Servers.Auth_Manager;
--    Grant : Security.OAuth.Servers.Grant_Type;
--
--      Realm.Token (Params, Grant);
--
--  === Accessing Protected Resources ===
--  When accessing a protected resource, the API implementation will use the
--  <tt>Authenticate</tt> operation to verify the access token and get a security principal.
--  The security principal will identify the resource owner as well as the application
--  that is doing the call.
--
--     Realm : Security.OAuth.Servers.Auth_Manager;
--     Grant : Security.OAuth.Servers.Grant_Type;
--     Token : String := ...;
--
--       Realm.Authenticate (Token, Grant);
--
--  When a security principal is returned, the access token was validated and the
--  request is granted for the application.
